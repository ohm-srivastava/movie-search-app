This is a Project created using Create-react-app

The project is hosted at ohm-srivastava.github.io/movie-search-app Hop over and take a look!

The MovieSearch.js file grabs data from the TMDB API and puts the information into a <div> that is rendered using React on the frontend, styled using basic css. The file is clearly commented, to make it easy to understand each line of the code. 
  
The app is hosted on github pages, using a changed build script in the package.json file that set the docs folder as the build path once npm run build is called in the console. 

To host this project yourself, initialize a React application using create-react-app and replace the contents of the public index.html file, replace the default styles.css files in the same folder created by create-react-app and paste the index.css file in. Replace the contents of the default index.js file with teh one from this repository, and add the MovieSearch.js file to the src directory as well. 

run npm init in the console and the app will be launched in a browser window.
